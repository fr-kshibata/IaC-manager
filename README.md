- Public Key Access with Agent support/ Agent Forwarding:

  ```bash
  ssh-add pemfile.pem
  ssh -A user@ip
  ```

#### Steps for installation
- Clone this repo .
- `cp terraform.dummy terraform.tfvars`
- Modify params in `terraform.tfvars`
- Modify params in `variable.tf` to change subnet or add AMI accordingly to your aws region
- Export AWS credentials as bash variables (e.g. `ap-northeast-1` for Tokyo and `ap-southeast-1` for Singapore region):
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey" 
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="ap-northeast-1"
```
- Run `terraform plan` to see the plan to execute.
- Run `terraform apply` to run the scripts.

`terraform.tfvars.{prod/dev/stage}` files (already ignored by `.gitignore`).

#### Generate Docs 
Generate terraform documentation by running `bash generate-docs.sh`

- SSH into the manager node and check whether `terraform.out` in `home/centos` contains:
a record of the VPC, Subnet, Security Group and Nat gateway ID.
